A recipe website with several filters which uses an existing recipe API to provide a user-friendly interface to the user.

In a Human-Computer Interaction context, the main goals of the website are:

* A simple user-interface
* A vast array of recipes targetting studying abroad students
* Various filters regarding allergenics, ingredients and different types of diet
* Voice search
* Intuitive for every language
* Responsiveness
* Portability

Project developed by me, Mark Zwart and Eva de Wit.
